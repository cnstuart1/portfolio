## Projects
### Predictive Maintenance | Renewable Energy
- Predict the failure of generators for a wind energy company to help reduce machinery maintenance costs. The model predicted occurrence of failures in wind turbine generators ~87% +/- 2% based on 40 factors (variables) in a ciphered (blind) dataset.
- Determined most important factors (variables) influencing the prediction of failures. The top 5 accounted for nearly 37% of the relative importance.
- Built 21 classification models using 7 different machine learning algorithms, including Tree-based (Decision Trees, Random Forest) & boosted models (XGBoost). Compared all combinations and permutations of up sampling and down sampling.
- Optimized the model to ensure that the maximum number of generator failures were predicted correctly (i.e., minimize false negatives). Used recall as scorer in cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning. 
- Reduce overall machinery maintenance costs by considering costs of inspection, repair, and replacement.

### Clustering stock analysis |  Finance
- Built a diversified portfolio by analyzing and clustering stocks based on financial attributes.
- Analyzed stock data for 340 companies, grouped the stocks into 5 clusters based on 15 attributes using both K-Means and Hierarchical clustering analysis techniques.
- Identified similar and dissimilar characteristics within attribute data points (price, volatility, industry sector, and typical financial indicators) by performing EDA, scaling the data, and correlating features.
- Chose the optimal number of groups, compared results of both, and shared insights about the characteristics of each group which helped develop an optimized portfolio for clients with custom risk-return profiles.

### Project List
- Built a diversified portfolio by analyzing and clustering stocks based on financial attributes.
- Predicted the failure of generators for a wind energy company to help reduce machinery maintenance costs.
- Facilitated the process of visa approvals and recommend suitable profiles for visa certification and denial using ensemble ML models.
- Determined the cancellation status of hotel bookings and identify its driving factors using classification models.
- Built a dynamic pricing model for a used and refurbished devices seller using linear regression and identify key factors.
- Used A/B testing to identify the effectiveness of the new landing page of an online news portal.
- Perform data analysis and provide actionable insights for a food aggregator company to help improve the business.
